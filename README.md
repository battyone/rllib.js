# rllib.js
Reinforcement learning library with JavaScript.  
This library provides some reinforcement learning algorithms and environments.  
At this moment uses [TensorFlow.js](!https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs) to implement functions and [three.js](!https://threejs.org/) to visualizing.  

## Algorithms:  
Deep Q-learning:  
- [x] Base Deep Q-learning  
- [ ] Dueling Q-learning  
- [ ] Double Q-learning  

Policy gradient:  
- [ ] REINFORCE  
- [ ] Actor-Critic  
- [ ] PPO  
- [ ] TRPO  

## Environments:
Without physics:
Flat world 3D.
Visual lib: [three.js](!https://threejs.org/)
